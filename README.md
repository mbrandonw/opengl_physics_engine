### An OpenGL Physics Engine

I wrote this in high school and only just recently found it, 14 years later. It's a fully functional 2D physics engine with a 3D camera for watching simulations. Unfortunately I'll probably never get this to compile, so use your imagination.

Accompanying this code base is a website I made to showcase it. Who better to describe this behemoth than 16 year old me:

### License

I threw an MIT license in this repo for giggles, but honestly I like the ad hoc license I wrote 14 years ago:

> The source is free to use or abuse under no restrictions. This was merely a school project and I have no intention of using this every again, as I hope to never take a computer science class again. I do not think my name appears anywhere on any of the sources either, so do not worry about using it. It may be a little hard to use it in one of your own projects, but if you do it will not bother me in the least.
